# ðŸŽ¯ What is it?
# We analyze the distribution of label_sentiment across the entire dataset â€” i.e., how many reviews are labeled as positive, neutral, or negative based on their text.
# ðŸ’¡ Why is it important? (First Principles Thinking)
# Any e-commerce platform needs to understand the general mood of its customers.
# If most reviews are positive, that signals good product quality or buyer satisfaction.
# If there's a high number of neutral or negative reviews, this may hint at recurring issues or unmet expectations.
# This gives a baseline for all further analysis â€” you must know where you stand before asking "why."
