# ðŸŽ¯ What is it?
# This visualization shows how sentiment mismatches are distributed across different review types (short, medium, long).
# A mismatch occurs when the sentiment from the text doesn't align with the rating sentiment.
# ðŸ§  Why is This Insightful?
# Helps identify which review lengths are more prone to sentiment-rating mismatches.
# May reveal patterns in how review length relates to sentiment consistency.
# ðŸ’¼ Business Value
# Guides review collection strategy (e.g., encouraging longer/shorter reviews).
# Helps in prioritizing which reviews to analyze for customer satisfaction issues.
