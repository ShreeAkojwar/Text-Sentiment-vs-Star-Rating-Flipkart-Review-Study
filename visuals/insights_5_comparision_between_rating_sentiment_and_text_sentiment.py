# ðŸŽ¯ What is it?
# We compare the number of reviews by:
# rating_sentiment â†’ what the user clicked (based on stars)
# label_sentiment â†’ what the text really says (based on NLP)
# ðŸ§  Why is This Insightful?
# This checks whether people rate emotionally or rationally.
# Youâ€™ll often find mismatches like:
# People giving 4â˜… but writing complaints.
# Or giving 2â˜… but praising the product (maybe due to delivery delay, etc.)
# ðŸ’¼ Business Value
# Helps brands detect false positivity (good ratings with bad experience).
# Improves trust scoring for reviews.
# Suggests whether customers are sugarcoating or overreacting with ratings.
