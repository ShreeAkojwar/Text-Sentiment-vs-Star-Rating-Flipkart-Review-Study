# ðŸŽ¯ What is it?
# We're analyzing how different types of reviews (short, medium, long) relate to sentiment â€” based on what users wrote (label_sentiment).
# ðŸ§  Why is this Insightful? (First Principles Thinking)
# People write differently when they're angry, satisfied, or confused.
# A long review may signal strong emotion (positive or negative), while short ones are often quick reactions.
# By analyzing this, we learn how deeply customers express their emotions, and what kind of feedback is more common.
# ðŸ’¼ Business Value
# Helps identify which kind of reviews (short/long) are more emotionally charged.
# Customer support teams can prioritize longer negative reviews.
#Platforms can encourage detailed feedback if it's shown to offer clearer sentiment.
